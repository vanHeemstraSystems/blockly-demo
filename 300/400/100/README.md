# 100 - Workspace Creation

A Blockly workspace is the highest level component of Blockly. It is the UI that you use to program with blocks.

For more information about the workspace and its subcomponents, see the [visual glossary](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/get-started/workspace-anatomy).

## 100 - Injection div

A Blockly workspace must be injected into a ```<div>```, called the "injection div".

The injection div can be sized [statically](https://google.github.io/blockly-samples/examples/fixed-demo/index.html) or [dynamically](https://google.github.io/blockly-samples/examples/resizable-demo/index.html). Blockly elements within the div update their size when the window resizes.

The following code snippet shows the HTML for a statically sized injection div:

```
<div id="blocklyDiv" style="height: 480px; width: 600px;"></div>
```
