# 100 - Get Blockly

The Blockly team recommends requiring Blockly through a package manager (like [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blockly) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/package/blockly)) because:

- It is easier to stay up to date with changes in Blockly
- It encourages [using plugins](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/plugins/overview) instead of monkeypatching Blockly
